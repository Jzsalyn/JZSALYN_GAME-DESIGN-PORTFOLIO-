<h2> Description: Our group designed a video game for 12 year olds and up. The player will be playing a bus driver. The player will make it's way through the galaxy dropping off students. Before the students get dropped off a short quiz will pop up. The player will answer questions about grammar and vocabulary. During the journey through the different planets the player will learn interesting facts about the different planets. </h2>

     <h2> Design and Production Process:</h2>
<ul> <li> Brainstormed different ideas</li>
<li> We made a plan to do space theme</li> 
    <li> We came up with a plot and storyline for the game </li>
    <li> Each person sketched out their own  characters for their planets</li>
</ul>
<h2> Reflection :</h2>
<ul>  <li> After this project I learned about: </li>
</ul>
<ul> <li> Adding more depth to the game, for example a plot and storyline to keep players more engaged</li> <li> How to make our designs more fun, creative, and aesthetic to the audience </li> <li> How to effectively communicate with others</li>
</ul>
    <ul><li> If I could do things differently, I would:</li>
<li> Make a checklist of all the things we needed to get done</li> <li> Had communicated with eachother and made sure that we all were on the same page</li></ul>
